# Planning


## Git Workflow
- Dev is the pseudo Main Branch, and should only be updated by pull request
- Team Members will create unique branches for themselves, and for new features
- Pull Requests will be merged during daily team reviews.

## Planning Workflow
- Each file will be planned on a .md file, which will be kept as a shadow copy of its sibling .jsx file
- The Planning Directory will adopt the same structure as the app directory, serving as a shadow copy of the entire app.
- the Log Directory will hold .dm files for each programmer, where they will document their progress daily.

## Best Practices
- Arrow Functions
- Axios
- Async
- .jsx
- Team semicolon;
- Util Directory
- no styled components
- update your dev log every day.
- exact paths on Routes
